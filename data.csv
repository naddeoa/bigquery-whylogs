Grr! Linebreaks do not appear in the comment text!

The premise of the book seems to be that you're going to learn about how to run a startup by reading about successful ones-- that is, you're going to look at a bunch of successful startups, and say Hmm, what makes for a successful startup? 


Another way to put it is that you're trying to train a classifier-- how do you tell whether a startup is going to succeed? Well, if it has a, b, and c qualities in x, y, and z amounts. However, a key part in training classifiers is having negative as well as positive examples. It seems that from reading *just* about successful startups, you could incorrectly infer a bunch of necessary qualities for successful startups, when in fact those are qualities of all startups, or those are just qualities of the sample taken, and focusing on them is bogus. Having no direct experience in the matter, I can't give good examples, but it seems like you could fall victim to a breakdancing chicken problem: (made up example) all the interviewed startups wrote software, so writing software is an important step towards having a successful startups. Well, no, but it just happened that the interviewer focused on software startups. If you had examples of failed startups, you'd see that there was just sampling bias to",157,,,0

Well, they're usually trying to beat the clock. If their average call time goes above some magic number (often as low as two or three minutes) then they get written up by their supervisor. No such problem at Lands' End.

As for what happens to the returned items? They're sold off in the company employee store for a few dollars.

2) I didn't realize at first that the arrows were used for voting.  The main page (http://news.ycombinator.com/) had only &#34;up&#34; arrows.  I figured they were used to collapse/expand additional content, so I ended up inadvertently trying to vote for several arbitrary items (I hadn't created an account yet, so the votes didn't count - I don't think).

You can certainly reinvest profits from an S-corporation into the business or pay out profits from a C-corporation as dividends, but the incentives go different ways.  S-corp earnings are taxed as ordinary income (none of the double-taxation of corporate profits) and S-corps can't give out different classes of shares, so there's an incentive to distribute the profits out to the shareholders.  C-corp earnings are taxed once at the corporate level and then once as dividend earnings, yet they can have multiple classes of shareholders.  The incentive is to build up the business and eventually seek an IPO, acquisition, or other liquidity event.

This is especially true for many website based on advertising models. Also ventures based around getting big partnerships (e.g. licensing deals) may require the prestige of VC backing before you can get through the door.<p>Secondly you might have an option of growing organically for 3 years and hoping that no one else enters the market and that its still buoyant in that time or growing fast with VC support. I am not saying it's not possible to grow fast without VCs but I am sure it helps. I think it just comes down to what business it is.

Not having expectations of growing a startup to Facebook, Google or Bebo size you are going to be wasting a VC's time. This is no mean feat - you have to be mentally prepared to grow and scale a company like mad and similarly your startup must have proved its case for being able to scale.<p>Whats the best way to know if your startup is ready? build a prototype, get some traction, look at the numbers, measure, experiment then measure again. If you truly are going to scale (and you are growing at 1% a day) and you've experimented enough that you've found a suitable path you'll end up needing money of the VC scale.<p>It doesn't cost much to sit around and build something. Go and test it - figure out what people want first - change your assumptions and above all PROVE that if you scaled your site it'd be worth it for investors. You don't need VC yet to start something and test it out - If it comes to that point well thats something to think about.<p>I'm reminded of the story Michael Birch of Bebo tells - they built something, put it out there off the traffic of birthday alarm and experimented with features. Every time a feature added to the growth of the site and got a noticeable increase in users they kept it and tried something else which also contributed to the growth. By experimenting, measuring and then iterating for things which correlated for growth they ended up on the right path. When they had 5 million users and were growing month on month they had the numbers to prove themselves. They took $15m from Benchmark capital. The bottom line - you'll know when you are ready: just go prove the numbers. ",761,,,0

I could see something like Hotmail or Skype being bootstrapped with this method, because those services are useful to both individuals and businesses. Back then, email from any PC with the internet or free international voice calls would have been things that many businesses would have paid for (and still would, if there weren't so many free alternatives now). Even Reddit got its NYT deal soon after starting which pushed it into the black, did it not? (not rhetorical - I don't know much about their history so tell me if I'm wrong!)<p>There is the problem of loss of focus though. If a company like Hotmail started in '95, realised it could make millions selling their product to companies and focused on that (sales, turnkey servers for easy installation), they would probably only get a few years of that income at most before they are dethroned by a company that just focused on making the best web based email possible. So it would be a bit of a local maxmimum.

Hes got just the thing.<p>Videos have multiplied on social networks like YouTube and MySpace as well as on news and entertainment sites because of the emergence of video-sharing, user-generated video, free digital storage and broadband and Wi-Fi networks.<p>Today, owing to the proliferation of large video files, video accounts for more than 60 percent of the traffic on the Internet, according to CacheLogic, a company in Cambridge, England, that sells media delivery systems to Internet service providers. I imagine that within two years it will be 98 percent, says Hui Zhang, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.<p>But search engines  like Google  that were developed during the first, text-based era of the Web do a poor job of searching through this rising sea of video. Thats because they dont search the videos themselves, but rather things associated with them, including the text of a Web page, the metadata that computers use to display or understand pages (like keywords or the semantic tags that describe different content), video-file suffixes (like .mpeg or .avi), or captions or subtitles.<p>None of these methods are very satisfactory. Many Internet videos have little or obscure text, and clips often have no or misleading metadata. Modern video players do not reveal video-file suffixes, and captions and subtitles imperfectly capture the spoken words in a video.<p>The difficulties of knowing which videos are where challenge the growth of Internet video. If there are going to be hundreds of millions of hours of video content online, Mr. Chandratillake said, we need to have an efficient, scalable way to search through it.<p>Mr. Chandratillakes history is unusual for Silicon Valley. He was born in Sri Lanka in 1977 and divided his childhood among England and various countries in South Asia where his father, a professor of nuclear chemistry, worked. Then he studied distributed processing at Kings College, Cambridge, before becoming the chief technology officer of Autonomy, a company that specializes in something called meaning-based computing. This background possibly suggested an original approach to search when he founded Blinkx in 2004.<p>Mr. Chandratillakes solution does not reject any existing video search methods, but supplements them by transcribing the words uttered in a video, and searching them. This is an achievement: effective speech recognition is a nontrivial problem, in the language of computer scientists.<p>Blinkxs speech-recognition technology employs neural networks and machine learning using hidden Markov models, a method of statistical analysis in which the hidden characteristics of a thing are guessed from what is known.<p>Mr. Chandratillake calls this method contextual search, and he says it works so well because the meanings of the sounds of speech are unclear when considered by themselves. Consider the phrase recognize speech,  he wrote in an e-mail message. Its phonemes (rek-un-nise-peach) are incredibly similar to those contained in the phrase wreck a nice beach. Our systems use our knowledge of which words typically appear in which contexts and everything we know about a given clip to improve our ability to guess what each phoneme actually means.<p>While neural networks and machine learning are not new, their application to video search is unique to Blinkx, and very clever.<p>How good is blinkx search? When you visit blinkx.com, the first thing you see is the video wall, 25 small, shimmering tiles, each displaying a popular video clip, indexed that hour. (The wall provides a powerful sense of the collective mind of our popular culture.)<p>To experiment, I typed in the phrase Chronic  WHAT  cles of Narnia, the shout-out in the Saturday Night Live digital short called Lazy Sunday, a rap parody of two New York slackers. I wanted a phrase that a Web surfer would know more readily than the real title of a video. I also knew that Lazy Sunday, for all its cultish fame, would be hard to find: NBC Universal had freely released the rap parody on the Internet after broadcasting it in December 2005, but last month the company insisted that YouTube pull it.<p>Nonetheless, Blinkx found eight instances of Lazy Sunday when I tried it last week. By contrast, Google Video found none. Typing Lazy Sunday into the keyword search box on Googles home page produced hundreds of results  but many were commentaries about the video, and many had nothing to do with Saturday Night Live.<p>Blinkx, which has raised more than $12.5 million from angel investors, earns money by licensing its technology to other sites. Although Blinkx has more than 80 such partners, including Microsoft, Playboy, Reuters and MTV, it rarely discloses the terms of its deals. Mr. Chandratillake said some licensees pay Blilnkx directly while others share revenue and some do both. Blinkx has revealed the details of one deal: ITN, a British news broadcaster, will share the revenue generated by advertising inserted in its videos.<p>For all of Blinkxs level coolness, there are at least three obvious obstacles to the companys success.<p>First, because Google Video is not much good now doesnt mean it wont get better: after all, when Blinkx was founded, it first applied machine learning to searching the desktops of personal computers, a project that was abandoned when Google and Microsoft released their own desktop search bars.<p>Second, even if Google improbably fails to develop effective video search, the field will still be crowded: TruVeo, Flurl, ClipBlast and other start-ups are all at work on different subsets of the market.<p>Finally, Blinkx might not go far enough in searching the content of videos: the company searches their sounds, but not their images.<p>THIS last objection is the most serious.<p>Because Blinkx emphasizes speech recognition, there is a great amount of multimedia content that they cannot address, like photographs, said John R. Smith, a senior manager in the intelligent information management department of I.B.M.s T. J. Watson Research Center in Hawthorne, N.Y. But whats worse, speech is not a very good indicator of whats being shown in a video.<p>Mr. Smith says he has been working on an experimental video search engine called Marvel, which also uses machine learning but organizes visual information as well as speech.<p>Still, at least for now, Blinkx leads video search: it searches more than seven million hours of video and is the largest repository of digital video on the Web.<p>Search is our navigation, our interface to the Internet, said John Battelle, chief of Federated Media Publishing and author of The Search, an account of the rise of Google. With Blinkx, we may have such an interface for digital video, and be a little closer to Mr. Chandratillakes vision of a universal remote control.<p>Jason Pontin is the editor in chief and publisher of Technology Review, a magazine and Web site owned by M.I.T.

This seems to have almost become standard practice now. I don&#39;t really think this is a great idea, and I often won&#39;t take an interview that requires an NDA.  But sometimes if I am certain that I won&#39;t be developing my own ideas in the field I&#39;ll sign one. Inevitably I find that these employment related NDAs are the most frivolous, silly, and irrelevant ones I sign.  YMMV.

I would imagine the bigger problem here, however, is context switching.  Because Apache (and most other servers) use OS threading or forking, the entire state of the current process (let&#39;s say) has to be put aside and then restored later, maybe after only a few milliseconds- because the OS isn&#39;t going to presume anything about the state of that process.  In Erlang&#39;s concurrency model it simply runs 20 (or so, I think- anyway some static number) functions and then goes to another process.<p>Because the functions are, uh, functional there is almost no state to save and restore when there is a context switch.  Also because things like iteration are done with recursion- the 20 functions and then context switch doesn&#39;t get hung up on some loop somewhere.  The faster the OS tries to keep switching between processes, the more overhead it introduces.<p>BTW, this is why in my opinion you don&#39;t see a lot of other systems duplicating this sort of concurrency model- because there are some language &#34;limitations&#34; (recursion only, for example) that make it possible.<p>Most apache, erlang, or kernel hackers would know way more about this than I do, of course.",1160,,,0

And there are two fundamental problems.<p>The first problem is the institutional structure of the US education system. In my experience, tech-savvy instructors rarely look for a generic CMS solution. And those without much tech experience resist change unless it is forced upon them because they are already good at what they do and change disrupts their ability to get their jobs done. Blackboard gets around this inertia by selling to university and school administrations, which then push the technology out throughout campuses. It is a top-down sales regime. The company has non-compete clauses so that instructors cannot adopt other systems even if they wanted to. Competing with Blackboard on their own terms would mean wining and dining a lot of administrators who are not going to be interested in beta-testing software.<p>The second problem is more fundamental. A lot of the really interesting stuff happening in the education field is happening with interest based communities like Chinesepod or even open source software projects (for an education in programming...). There are two things that are common to both sorts of communities: #1 they are interest driven, #2 the materials produced are not attempts to solve specific institutional needs so much as address individual &#34;learner&#34; problems. <p>A project like this should be very clear about whether it is serving institutional or learner needs. If you don&#39;t know exactly how to help students, what is the point of creating a system simply to automate stuff?",1178,,,1

They&#39;ve won the war as far as universities are concerned.  However, universities generally do the job of teaching very well.  You also don&#39;t hear of fatal university shootings often (If ever?  I haven&#39;t looked.)  I&#39;m in it to improve the lives and education of high school students.  If I manage to better just one student&#39;s life, then I&#39;ll consider it mission accomplished.<p>High schools are very much open game.  They&#39;re open game because they can&#39;t typically afford the huge sums of money that universities can.  I plan to dominate the low end by creating a product that&#39;s simple, efficient, and inexpensive; something that every teacher would want.  I&#39;m not competing with Blackboard.  I&#39;m sidestepping them.<p>I agree that teachers have methods that they&#39;ve employed for years to teach students.  But part of that is exactly the problem.  When something is done exactly the same for years on end, it gets stale.  A teacher would have -fun- with my product, exploring other&#39;s ideas and communities.  I plan to make them happy.<p>They may be reluctant to use my product, but I plan to be with my two cofounders, on foot, visiting local high schools as soon as I have a feature set that&#39;s useful, and spending time with individual teachers to show them how they might benefit from it.  Then it&#39;s up to the teachers whether or not they&#39;ll use Classbug, but if I&#39;ve done my job well, they&#39;ll most certainly want to.<p>Shawn",1317,,,0

Which means that even if not more computing power is required you will be required to pay for another instance if you need more than 160GB. If we suppose you run one balancer, and two instance for database for replication, you need to pay at least 3 instances. 
Which is $72x3=$216/month=$2512/year.  For the traffic of 1.5mbit/s which is 474GB, means you need at least $94/month=$1128/year.

Dexter appears to be lifting his foot straight up off the ground and then falling forward to produce the forward motion. <p>The way humans walk is exactly the opposite. The toes are at a different angle from the foot (when walking), so that our feet effectively look something like ___/ , with the underscores being the foot and the / being the toes. We then transition from the ___ part of the foot to the / part of the foot and push forward, and land flat footed with the other foot. For whatever speed you are going, there is a proper ratio between landing on the ___ part of the foot and pushing off the / part of the foot, and that&#39;s where balance comes from. That is, the faster the acceleration of the fall, the faster you transition from ___ to / .<p>So in humans, balance comes from the way one step connects to the next step, whereas Dexter appears to be treating each step as a discrete unit, where it has to attain balance at the end of one step before going on to the next step.<p>If you actually have to balance yourself after each individual step instead of using the next step for balance, the problem seems in some ways to be much harder. <p>Also, the balance problem is greatly compounded by the small steps Dexter takes. Compare this to doing lunges. When you do a lunge, you basically take a long stride forward and then sink into it, all while keeping your torso perfectly upright. This gives you a much bigger platform for stability. As terrain gets steeper, the way humans walk becomes more like a lunge for this reason. <p>So my guess is that taking one tiny step and then balancing is the hardest part of this problem, because you have the least tools at your disposal. For example, you can&#39;t use the next step to balance you. However, once you can do the last step of the sequence, all the preceding steps working backward from the last one get progressively easier.<p>I don&#39;t know anything about robotics, but as an athlete and sports physiology geek I find the problem interesting.

The first is hosts. What is the comparison between hosts? The second is how mature the language is. If I want to use python and I need a particular module that does 'fo '. it is probably out there somewhere (though it may be alpha or beta it will most likely out of date) unless you want to re-invent the wheel.  I can't say the same for Rails. Ruby is just a younger language with less code mass.<p>QUESTIONS TO ASK: In the end what really matters is how good the idea & business is. There are plenty of Rail based companies I can think of making a go of it. The same applies to Python based companies. If you accept that technology is an amplifier of ideas, will using Rails or Django alone make a better choice? Is the difference between them compelling enough to make a difference?  One area that could tip in Rails favour is ""susinctness"". But Django with it's python code base has more tools to choose from.

The key thing to realize is that any particular feature that your language has doesn't necessarily matter.  For example, Python may happend to have a built-in way of doing<p>(with-input-file (in ""myfile.txt"")
  (do-something in))<p>In Python, this might look like<p>withInputFile in ""myfile.txt"":
 doSomething(in)<p>(hey, I told you I was rusty on my Python...especially my totally made up Python!)<p>So maybe the feature came built-in to Python, in which case you're lucky--Guido happened to decide to implement this feature.  But what if he hadn't?  Well, just write your own abstraction.  Obviously, Python can open files and do stuff with the file's contents.  So it seems logical that you should be able to create an abstraction which saves you from writing the same boilerplate that you do every time you open an input file.  Unfortunately, there are some abstractions that *you just can't write* in most languages (including Python).  This file open example is a good one.  Here's another example, in the form of a programming challenge:<p>In Python, create an abstraction called ""debugExpr"" that consumes an expression E, and then does two things:
  1) prints ""Expression E = V"", where E is the given expression, and V is the value E evaluates to.
  2) returns the value V.<p>For example,<p>%python% 6 * debugExpr(2+3)<p>Expression 2+3 = 5<p>30<p>I'm betting you can't implement debugExpr in Python.  So assuming Guido didn't extend the language to implement this feature, you're pretty much SOL.  It's a shame because debugExpr, I think, is pretty darn useful.  It means that you can take any expression in your code and ""inspect it"", without worrying about adjusting the structure of your program, and without affecting its semantics.  Without debugExpr, I'd have to change my example code to be something like this to get the same result:<p>print ""Expression 2+3 =""<p>tmp = 2+3<p>print tmp<p>6 * tmp<p>

We thought it would be the perfect place to try to do something like what you suggested: to use a Reddit-like interface to collect comments and discussions on scientific literature.  So Reddit set it up at arxiv.reddit.org.<p>As you can see, there is not much happening.  In fact, the main lesson learned here was not that a reddit-like platform is not ideal to this type of knowledge pooling, but that the scientific community is in general skeptical about this type of information sharing.  We did not require email address validation for logins (hence the spam you can see up there), but we did talk about it with a lot of people and there were good arguments on both sides.  I talked with physicists, biologists and mathematicians about using this type of site, and the replies were mostly those of insecurity about sharing incomplete ideas: both because they might be wrong (and not many scientists like that), and because if they were right, they would rather keep it to themselves and publish it.<p>Actually Paul Ginsparg, the creator of arxiv.org, kind of warned us before we launched that it would take mostly a huge grass-roots effort to get scientists going on something like this.  He was right, and from listening to some of his stories about how he started arxiv.org, it apparently took him over 5 years of grass-roots convincing before it took off, despite being clearly a very good idea.<p>If you are interested in scientific knowledge sharing, with an eye towards collaboration, check out openwetware.org, which uses the mediawiki wiki platform.  Note that they actually do require account authentication, so have a lot less spam issues at this point.  It seems like a wiki platform is more easily adopted for scientists (although still hesitantly), as the subreddit oww.reddit.com, which we tried to push to the openwetware community, has not taken off (this time because of concerns that Reddit is a company.)",484,,,0

We have been using Rails for about a year now, and really enjoyed it from the very start because it did so much for us.  Well we have prototyped the idea and would like to start building it for real, and we kept getting caught by Rails when we tried to go against the grain.<p>So we started to look into other web application frameworks, and turned up a lot of comparison between two python-based frameworks, Django and Turbogears, with Rails.  Although they were all very outdated, they all boiled down to using a python-based framework if you want more of the internals exposed (because you have include a lot more code to explicitly specify what you want to do), and use Rails if you don't want these details exposed.  To be fair, you can always dive into the rails code itself to look at the internals, so it is more of a question of how you want your application code to look.<p>As I don't have too much Turbogears experience at this point, I would gladly welcome a re-analysis of the comparison from someone who does.

As I understand it, Reddit is like this: Steve does the coding while Alexis does all the other miscellaneous work.  Sun had 4 founders, but Bill Joy did the programming.  AFAIK, DHH did most of the initial programming for 37signals, though they obviously have more now.  Their advice (in ""Getting Real"") was to start with one programmer, one designer, and one person who could do swing work - a little server admin here, a little CSS work there.  This also squares with Fred Brooks's advice in Mythical Man Month - a programming team should be organized like a surgical team, with one lead programmer and 5-7 people running support so he has no distractions.<p>There're some big advantages to this structure, mostly involving communications overhead.  With one programmer, you don't need to coordinate who does what.  You don't need to explain what needs to be done.  You don't waste time fixing broken interfaces.  You can move quickly and add whatever features the customers want.<p>I've worked for two startups that have both suffered by starting with a team of 4-5 (1 founder + 3-4 employees) instead of a single founder.  It's very hard to get everyone on the same page on the requirements, particularly if the employees don't know the domain well.

Finance for a tech startup usually has to tie into the product / subscriptions, etc- and is thus a tech problem.  PR is to fellow geeks, etc. etc.  Then there's the fact that the bulk of the work to be done is technical- if you're going to be having allnighters for the next 3 months getting a product out- there is a _big_ difference between having a partner who is right there with you in the trenches coding across the room, and a partner who comes by every day and says ""well, uh, how's it going?""- you spend the next hour trying to explain the latest hangup etc. and then they say ""well, let me know if the schedule changes- I've got some great customers lined up..."" or whatever.<p>Sometimes that situation is unavoidable, but I guarantee it is not optimal.",2041,,,0

But it would totally eliminate people  artifically increasing their Adsense clicks, and if they optimised for the Google income per Adsense view on a site by site basis, then the long tail would effectively be safe from people trying to decrease the rank of their competitors.

I've found that it actually lets you have more complex ideas than you would be able to have by starting with an outline (or god forbid just freewriting). The idea is that writing should be about ideas, and words are only there to express your ideas. Because of this it doesn't make sense to start putting pen to paper until you figure out what you believe. And it's a lot easier to figure out what you believe what you can drag and drop pure ideas around instead of mucking around with text. <p>Concept maps are another tool that lets you do this, but since writing is fundamentally either flat or hierarchical in terms of how you express ideas, I think mindmaps work better. (Concept maps are essentially like thinking in 3D, which becomes a problem when you need to translate your 3D ideas into 2D writing. Also, a lot of concept maps end up with really murky causality, which kind of defeats the whole point which is to clean up your thinking.)",2098,,,0

The prediction market was set up in August 2004, and the product that ""had been in the works for a long time"" was scheduled to ship in November 2004. <p>Each ""trader"" received $50 in their account to start with, and was told that the more accurate their prediction, the more money they would make. The market opened with an initial price of on-time delivery set to 16 2/3 cents.<p>""The price of 'before November' dropped to zero right away,"" Proebsting said. ""The price of 'on time' in about two to three minutes dropped to 2.3 cents on the dollar."" Translated, that's more than 30-to-1 odds against on-time delivery.<p>Then the woman who was responsible for scheduling started trying to convince her colleagues who were buying and selling future delivery dates. ""She was able to talk (on-time delivery) up to around 3 cents,"" Proebsting said. ""People really enjoyed moving the price...They loved this.""<p>""The next day the director comes into my office and said, 'What have you done?'"" Proebsting said.

That is, the product being advertised potentially creates value for the user. So basically the user has to click on the link and buy the product.<p>The most profitable advertising is the type where the ad itself creates value for the user, in addition to the product being advertised. For example, music videos on MTV.<p>Unfortunately all of the social networks in existence today are monetized under the traditional model.<p>The startup I'm currently working on (kitchen table phase) is a social networking thing that actually allows users to manipulate advertising spatially in three dimensions.

You could even take other people's photos and embed them around the web and in other applications. It was pretty sweet.<p>As a result they quickly dominated the photo sharing scene and were bought out by Yahoo! in record time.<p>Flickr's sustainable competitive advantage was freedom.<p>Back in June the Flickr team was having an internal debate about whether or not to allow competitors to data mine their site. Flickr's founder, Stewart Butterfield, posted a comment on his blog saying, <p>*******<p>""T]his is something that we've never had any set policy on and this thread has sparked a lot of internal debate on the team: some people felt that it was unreasonable, some people felt like it didn't matter since Flickr should win on the basis of being the best thing out there.<p>I actually had a change of heart and was convinced by Eric's position that we definitely should approve requests from direct competitors as long as they do the same. That means (a) that they need to have a full and complete API and (b) be willing to give us access.<p>The reasoning here is partly just that 'fair's fair' and more subtly, like a GPL license, it enforces user freedom down the chain. I think we'll take this approach (still discussing it internally).""<p>*******<p>This makes sense for a non-profit like Wikipedia but it was a bad idea in this case. Flickr made their money by tapping the differential in the freedom gradient, so by requiring reciprocal openness they are literally forcing the competition to steal their sustainable advantage.<p>The paradox is they'd be better off just bending over and taking it. That's pretty fucked up.<p>Or, as Thomas Pynchon says, ""If you can get them asking the wrong questions, you don't have to worry about the answers.""

Judging from your articles, I sense that there is a certain, though justified, bias towards funding younger startup founders. This is the excerpt I am referring to:<p>""The other reason it's hard to start a company before 23 is that people won't take you seriously. VCs won't trust you, and will try to reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding. Customers will worry you're going to flake out and leave them stranded.

They build a database model of how close words relate to each other & use this to compute word combinations. The closer the word combinations, the closer the association.

The core architecture of OpenID makes it possible for users or small groups of users to operate their own OpenID servers, avoiding the need to hand their personal information over to any third party to prove their (pseudonymous) identity.  If it becomes standard practice to filter OpenID requests to only allow authentication from certain large providers, then OpenID becomes no better than any other single-sign-on system.<p>Moreover, there is no advantage to filtering authentication sources.  An OpenID authentication is merely an assertion that the user is authorized to use a given universally unique identifier.  The only way that the authentication source can cheat is by permitting auths that it should deny, or vice versa.  Because users can choose the authentication source they use, there is no incentive for such cheating.  In the case of a private person running their own OpenID server, the only attack would be for that person to attack their own account, nonsensically.<p>If you're unconvinced of the security of permitting anyone to serve, consider the analogy to Jabber servers: anyone can run their own, federating into the wider XMPP network, and the network maintains security because the misbehavior of one server only affects that server's users.",2697,,,0

If your smart, that'll carry over to employees too: they'll feel like they're working for the company and customers and not just for you.  That kind of culture is very difficult to generate after the fact.

This problem has two parts:<p>A) Not knowing enough people interested in startups.<p>B) Not knowing if people would make good or bad co-founders.<p>So this is certainly a step toward solving part A. The problem is it really does nothing toward solving part B, which is by far the hardest part of the puzzle. <p>I'm sitting here reading news.YC and there are comments from dozens of smart people, some of whom would make great co-founders and some wouldn't. The issue isn't for the most part isn't the fact that I don't know they exist; I know they all exist. The issue is a lack of identity. <p>If you want to solve the co-founder problem, the solution isn't to get a large amount of people interested in starting companies in the same room. The solution comes from getting them to know each other. This comes from two things:<p>A) Identity.<p>B) Interaction.<p>Identity is 10% what we say about ourselves, and 90% what others say about us based on previous actions. To solve the identity problem you need a way to either aggregate what others say about us or else shine light on previous actions. (Previous actions being anything from college degrees to old blog posts.)<p>Interaction comes from objects of sociability. Playing games. Breaking a loaf of fresh bread. Sharing a bottle of wine over dinner. A pot of tea. Solving hard problems together. Solving difficult problems together. etc.<p>Anyway, my point is that the website doesn't solve a problem.

From my limited experience, talking about your ideas to both laypeople and technical people can only help you.<p>Talking to laypeople helps you solidify and lets you practice pitching what it is that you're doing.  When you're working at a company, you don't have to explain yourself very much.  But when you say you're doing a startup, I've found that most people will demand more of an explanation.  However, most people don't have the patience in everyday settings to listen to more than 2 or 3 minutes of it.  This helps you whittle out the core of what it is that you're trying to build.

For example, if it's a web-based social networking app, send your beta announcement mail to, say, 10 people or 50 people and track views and signups for 2-3 weeks. See what kind of network effect you get. Pick your initial invitees wisely. If you want users, then you want them to be the so-called influencers.<p>I also have this question. I am a little reticent, though, because I'm concerned about scalability. In my case, I am writing the front end in typical database-backed fashion, but the backend is several custom C++ components. So while I want users, I'm not sure how much I want them on day one. Everything I read says, ""get users, figure out your weaknesses, and scale as needed."" That's reassuring. Nevertheless, the unknowns that we face can still be daunting.<p>Larger companies and people who have been around the block will often use a PR firm or will simply file a press release themselves. It costs about $1000, from what I understand.<p>I think from the standpoint of your average bootstrapper, guerilla tactics are in order. I plan on using Google Analytics. I haven't tried it yet, but I plan to. It will, for example, show hits based on geographic location. You can use that to target local advertising in the markets where you're getting some initial traction. I don't think there is really a set approach. When you're a guerilla, anything is possible.

2) Consult an immigration lawyer (I did). It's not impossible to work in the US on a startup full-time, but there are a few issues you should be aware of (said issues might delay you). Our american friends do definitely have it easier though, as they can drop out of school and not get kicked out of the country :)<p>The US does actually provide visas (look up E-2 visas) for people who want to set-up businesses in the States (only for citizens of certain countries). But it does seem that these visas stem from a somewhat antiquated view of what starting a company entails (some of the documents required for an E-2 application are incorporation papers, a detailed business plan, bank statements and other financial documents
showing where the investment funds are from and how much are involved, business lease, receipts and documentation of equipments, supplies, inventories, contracts and receipts, customer/client list, etc.)<p>Anyway, best of luck.

I was just putting that out there. It sort of goes against the web model, anyway.<p>Having people give email addresses is one approach, but that realy only serves to give you a way to make a targeted announcement. Good, but not great. Having the site up and running is the crucial step. By the 80-20 rule, the last 20% of the features takes 80% of the time. Getting a product out the door is hard. <p>Once it's up, people will judge it pretty quickly, I think. They will look at it, judge it cool and come back, or judge it harshly and never come back again. Sometimes you get a second chance. If the product can be rapidly improved and you can maintain some buzz, then those lost users may see a reference to it and give it another try.

http://mealticket.wordpress.com/2007/02/13/demo-day/<p>""..when you think of Facebook as being one of the most exciting companies in the Valley right now and then you realize it's being driven by a young team it makes you question a lot of assumptions. So my 'intended' career path had been law - where your pay and rank is determined purely by the number of years you have worked at the firm for. When you hit a certain age maybe you make partner and maybe you don't. But the point is that age and experience rule in that culture and not raw ability. Why do we have to assume that we can measure the ability to perform well purely by the number of years someone has worked in a particular field? Mark Zuckerberg doesn't have 10 years experience of running companies worth $1 billion but he's doing a pretty good job of it so far.<p>
Why does someone who has spent 10 years analysing financial markets have a better chance of making a success out of an idea we live and breathe everyday? The attitude in the Valley is that your age is determined by the number of startups you've gone through - there are people here my age who have already started and scrapped a couple of companies. That gives them experience and all the 'grey hair' they need.""<p>Thanks for the great blog, Harj!",3546,,,0

Now, with Youtube, before Google invested anything in it,  Google sees a lawsuit coming which could change that.. They KNOW that youtube is likely to be sued, and don't want to have the judge define the laws in a way which screws them over.. They know this lawsuit is coming one way or another, and that Youtube is poor, so their legal defense is likely to..well..suck.<p>Google realizes that if they buy Youtube, they can use their considerable legal muscle and financial capital to DEFEND youtube, and to make sure that they law isn't redefined in a way that screws them.. <p>Since the US system works by a process of Common Law, the precedent is binding. That means that this case will be VERY influential in dertermining any other cases. And it's THOSE that is worried about.<p>THAT's why Google bought Youtube.

For entrepreneurs with a previous failure it was 20%, and for entrepreneurs with a previous success it was 33%.<p>I suspect that the success rate is somewhat higher for bootstrapped tech startups, because you're given the option of failing and trying again with the same company, different idea.  Usually if you fail with a VC's money, they liquidate the company.  If you fail with your own, you can take the assets you have and try to redirect them to a new line of business.<p>I thought I saw another study somewhere that said that the average number of failures a bootstrapped startup goes through is 4.

You have a 18% chance of succeeding on the first try, a 33% chance of succeeding by the second try (82% * 82% = 67.24% chance of failing), a 45% chance of succeeding by the third try, and a 55% chance of succeeding by the fourth try, for an average of 3-4 attempts necessary before success.",4055,,,0

This begs the question of what YC is: is it a company that forms more companies, or is it an angel-firm that creates more angel-firms?<p>The latter can work only by forming these new angel-firms in different startup-beds.  There are only a limited number of startup-beds, and a limited number of connections that can be used by partners.  When these resources are used up, the only choice is to move to another area and start again.<p>The former is what YC already does, within the limits of the partners.

The first mountain was computation (e.g., microprocessors), then usability, then networking/communications. What's next?

We will see an evolution of these tools and it will not only be something people can use to get more efficiency out of life, it will actually improve people's lives and societies (globally).  <p>If you think the effects social networks and human/computer interaction are amazing, wait until you see the children of these sites.  It is  *absolutely* not a coincidence that the founders of Reddit played WoW.  They realize that power of a website is directly correlated to the amount of user input into a website.  The dilemma we entrepreneurs are faced with today is creating systems that encourage maximum participation.<p>How does this tie into the 53,000 theory?  None of the big winners, and I am talking the big ones, facebook, myspace, google, msnpages, orkut, (these are the sites that lead the world in user participation) succeeded because of blog recommendations.  They succeeded because they were better ways of experiencing the Internet, not because some ÃÂexpertÃÂ on techcrunch told the geeks it was a cool product.  <p>Well, there are many amazing ""web 2.0"" websites out there that will never be used by the masses until their friends, not techcrunch, invites them.<p>On the Internet, the best solution always win.  Humans are economical; they do what is best for themselves.  When we create a search/browsing tool that is at the same time more rewarding and fun than myspace/wikipedia/delicious/digg we will see the whole world adopt this method, the same way the world has adopted the Google search, the same way all the ÃÂcoolÃÂ people are on myspace.  This website will not only be as ""cool"" and as fun, it will actually enhance people's lives.  <p>This is the future of the web.  It is also no coincidence that VC's like the one whom this post is referring to, have seen a lot of ""like delicious but XXX"" or ""Digg killers""  This is not just hype, one day it will happen.  One day there will be a delicapedieddit that will emerge as the new Internet powerhouse.  <p>",4101,,,0

It will never make a difference in what you do, and you'll probably never use it.  However, that remaining 1% can save you *huge* amounts of time or open up massive opportunities.<p>Just a couple examples where procrastination has changed my life.<p>When I was 16, my family went shopping at the Tanger 2 supermall in Riverhead NY.  I hate shopping.  So, I did what I normally do: I found a bookstore, grabbed an interesting book, curled up on the floor, and read half of it by the time my parents got back.  On that particular occasion, the book was ""Learn Java 1.0.2 in 7 days"" or some other tripe like that, the year was 1997, and the Java wave was just taking off.  One book led to a second and third, and then a whole shelf full, and eventually an internship at MITRE corporation.<p>While on the job, I was asked to learn Perl.  A couple years later, immediately after high school graduation, my math teacher's wife was starting a company and had an immediate need for some Perl programming.  In the year I spent at that company, I got to experience a dot-com run exclusively by teenagers, 3 different business plans, all the tribulations of a startup, and eventually an ugly VC takeover.<p>While slacking off at that company because I had no work to do, I found Fanfiction.net and the Harry Potter fandom.  I read a whole bunch of fics, then my workload picked up again and I promply forgot about it.  I went back to it during college, and ended up joining FictionAlley.org, which was just starting at the time.  Over the 4 years that I volunteered for FA, I saw it grow from 2,000 registered users to 100,000 registered users, from one machine to three, had my first experience managing teams of software developers and got to take my first major project from conception to completion.<p>Separate thread - at an internship after my freshman year, I was goofing off at work and reading Ward's Wiki.  I ended up getting pretty involved in housekeeping there after the internship ended, and struck up a few friendships.  One of them led *directly* to the startup I'm currently employed at, via a couple of internships.<p>Now that I'm co-founding a startup of my own, I'm finding that all the different internships and threads and so on pull together.  I know what to expect in terms of growing a community.  I've had experience with 2-3 different technology stacks (and found they all suck ;-), but at least that led me to one I'm reasonably happy with).  I know all about scaling concerns and breaking an app out over multiple boxes.  I've got some experience in judging whether a business model will fly or not.  (I think our business model sucks, BTW, and really doubt it'll get us off the ground, but we've gotta start somewhere.)<p>All of this came, in some way or another, from procrastination.<p>Incidentally, running a startup seems much the same way.  The vast majority of stuff you do is worthless, but the 1% that pays off really pays off big.  Unfortunately, you have no way of knowing what that 1% is until you try it.  People talk about how Bill Gates got lucky with the IBM deal - the thing is, Microsoft had a zillion balls in the air at the time, and if they hadn't gotten lucky with IBM they might very well have gotten lucky elsewhere.",4202,,,1

His point is that in order for a new idea or product to catch on, it first needs to be adopted by the ""innovators"" -- the ""geeks"".  Then, and only then, can it spread to the broader population.

I'm a Canadian who just finished school and here are the option my US-based immigration lawyer laid out for me:<p>1) E2 investment visa: not easy to do.

A legitimate option for Canadians and Mexican.  You need to find an American to own your startup in the U.S. and you start a company in either Mexico or Canada.  You then get hired by the owner of the U.S.-based company and get a TN-1.  You can't be the owner of the U.S.-based company but you can have an option to buy the whole thing.  <p>The nice part about this is that you then get the American-based company to issue you an H1-B visa the next year and you're well on your way to a Green Card.<p>3) L2.

Alot are also incorporated in Nevada (my home state).  There it's like 200$ total.  For a start-up, you normally don't need a whole lot of ""lawyer juice"" in the equation.  The forms are very simple.  You basically fill out the articles of incorporation document, then fill out a listing of officers/board members (initial listing of officers), which can be changed later.  You also need to have a resident agent, which doesn't need to be a physical place, so long as lawsuit stuff can get there.  Many places offer resident agencies as a service for as little as 99$.  The deputy just needs to be able to deliver you some lawsuit/whatever.  You send it all off to the secretary of state in whatever state you wish to incorporate, then in a few weeks later you get a copy of the forms back plus a certificate signed by the secretary of state saying that you're incorporated under that state.  Normally all states have a website where you can look up information about a particular corporation.  Every year you have to pay a few hundred bucks or so to rewnew the initial listing of officers.  It gets a little more complex if you have investors and the company is initially shared between several people/other companies, but overall, its really that simple.  <p>
Delaware might charge more because of the simple fact that so many companies incorporate there.  Finally, those ""incorporate"" services that charge a few grand basically give little advice and just fill the paper work out for you.  They take advantage of the naive.  ",4304,,,0
